# Blog: Requirements

## Introduction

This document details the requirements of the blog project.  The requirements are deliberately minimal and ambiguous, just as they often are in real life.

## Overview

We want a blog web site which allows the owner to create posts.

## Details

### Post

A post will consist of a title and a body of text.

### Public Site

The index page will list all the blog posts, their title with a short summary of their body.

Clicking on a post's title in that list will take the user to the view page for that post.

A view page for each blog post will show the entire post - the title at the top of the page, then the body.

### Admin Site

An admin interface is needed that will let the user:

* Post new blog posts.
* Edit existing blog posts.
* Delete existing blog posts.

## Conclusion

That's it, really simple.  There are of course many more complex and interesting features you'd probably want to add to a blog - we can get to those that provide a useful learning experience in time!
